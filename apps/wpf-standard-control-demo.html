    <h1>WPF Standard Control Demo App (.NET 10)</h1>
    <p>
      A demo application that showcases how standard WPF controls behave when running on .NET 10.
      Useful as a reference for UI layout, behavior, and styling.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Overview -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This application demonstrates how standard WPF controls operate on the .NET 10 runtime.
      It includes commonly used UI elements such as buttons, text boxes, check boxes, lists, and tabs,
      allowing you to verify their behavior in a single place.
      It is suitable for checking UI behavior, layout differences, and styling results when working with modern WPF applications.

  <!-- Development Background -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Development Background</h2>
    <p>
      WPF has been used for many years as a UI framework, but its behavior and styling can vary slightly
      depending on the .NET runtime version. With the introduction of .NET 10, developers may need to verify
      how existing controls behave or how UI elements appear under the latest runtime.
      This demo app was created to provide a simple way to check standard control behavior collectively.
      It is intended to support UI comparison, migration checks, and early-stage development verification.

  <!-- UI/UX Notes -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>UI / UX Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Controls are organized by category so that users can quickly find and test the UI elements they need.
      The layout is intentionally simple, allowing the behavior and appearance of each control to be observed clearly.
      A minimal design approach is used to make UI comparison and verification easier for developers.
