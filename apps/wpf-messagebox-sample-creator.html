    <h1>WPF MessageBox Sample Creator</h1>
    <p>
      A tool that allows you to configure and preview WPF <code>MessageBox</code> settings in real time.
      Useful for UI behavior verification and prototyping in Windows application development.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Overview -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      WPF MessageBox Sample Creator is an application that lets you interactively configure the standard WPF
      <code>MessageBox</code> and preview the result instantly. You can modify the text, caption, button layout, and icon,
      and immediately display the MessageBox with the selected settings.
      This tool is practical for UI behavior testing and application flow design, and can also be used by non-developer roles
      such as system designers or testers who need to review MessageBox configurations in real time.

  <!-- Development Background -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Development Background</h2>
    <p>
      In Windows application development, MessageBox behavior often needs to be checked repeatedly.
      However, writing code every time just to verify MessageBox behavior is inefficient and slows down UI flow adjustments.
      Additionally, non-developer members of a development team—such as system designers, testers, or planners—may need to
      confirm MessageBox specifications but lack an environment to easily preview them.
      This tool was created to solve these issues by enabling instant MessageBox previews without writing code.
      It aims to improve development efficiency and make UI specification review easier for all roles involved in system development.

  <!-- UI/UX Notes -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>UI / UX Notes</h2>
    <p>
      The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to focus on MessageBox behavior rather than tool operation.
      Controls are organized clearly, and the preview button is placed for quick access, enabling users to test multiple configurations efficiently.
      The layout is intended to be easy to use not only for developers but also for designers and testers who review UI specifications.
